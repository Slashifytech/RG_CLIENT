                <h2 className="font-bold pt-6">9. Cancellation and Refund</h2>
                <p className="pt-3">
                  The Buyback Program can be canceled by the Customer only upon
                  the failure of RAAM to offer the customer's desired value of
                  Buyback on their MG car. Upon such cancellation, the customer
                  will be refunded the amount paid at the time of purchase of
                  the Buyback Program from Raam, excluding the GST amount paid.
                  However, the following conditions must be fulfilled to be
                  eligible for a refund:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li className="pt-3">
                    <strong>First Right of Refusal:</strong> The first right to
                    purchase the MG car at the customer’s desired price must be
                    given to RAAM. This means getting the MG car evaluated by
                    Raam is mandatory. If RAAM denies the customer’s desired
                    value via an official email, the customer is free to sell
                    the car elsewhere.
                  </li>
                  <li className="pt-3">

                    must provide proof of the transaction for the resale of the
                    MG car within 15 days from the date of refusal.
                  </li>
                  <li className="pt-3">
